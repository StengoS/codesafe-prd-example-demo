In this last tutorial for this module on refactoring, you are asked by your manager to make sure the code is not using any
constants in any logic that involves comparisons. 

This time, there are also test cases to make sure SimpleSIEM operates as usual after your refactoring! That way, you can't 
just delete the function and call it a day. Usage test cases will continue to be something else you have to consider moving
forward. You can check the list of test cases in `checker` under the `TestSimpleSIEM` class.

Start by running the `checker` Python executable in `/challenge`. Make sure to run it with the following:
```
$ ./checker
```
The executable will give you further instructions.
